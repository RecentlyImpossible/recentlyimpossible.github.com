{"tagline":"67 West St #506 Brooklyn NY","body":"Floating Point, sometimes called \"The Center for the Recently Impossible\", is a design collective located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which is in desperate need of some filler text for this web page. Comprised of 5 graduates of the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, and a large, though unarmed, force of robots, we make things utilizing science, mathematics, technology, and a dollop of artistry (for intimacy). We are gritty, grimy, gunslinging—in attitude if not in the actual carrying of pistols—gurus of germaneness, the regents of relevancy. Good artists borrow, great artists steal; we are apparitions of appropriation—and the executives of ego. Also, admirals of alliteration. Awesome.\r\n\r\n - Jack Kalish\r\n - Gabriella Levine\r\n - Nick Yulman\r\n - Steve Klise\r\n - Noah Crowley","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
